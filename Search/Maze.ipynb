These algorithms assume that you already have a tree and the goal is to traverse all nodes. We are interested in dynamically creating a search tree with the aim of finding a good/the best path to the goal state. Follow the pseudo code presented in the text book closely. Ideally, we would like to search only a small part of the maze, i.e., create a search tree with as few nodes as possible. \n",
